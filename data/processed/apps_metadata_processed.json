    "description": "Text Summary is an AI-powered app built for people who want to get through information faster. Instead of reading full books, long documents, articles, or pages of text, Text Summary helps you extract what actually matters and presents it in clear, easy-to-digest formats.\r\n\r\nWhether you are working, researching, studying, or just trying to stay informed, Text Summary helps you cut through the noise and understand content in minutes instead of hours.\r\n\r\nYou can summarize content from many different sources:\r\n• Books and written material\r\n• PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, EPUB, ODT, and TXT files\r\n• Web pages and long online articles\r\n• Photos and scanned documents\r\n• YouTube video links\r\n• Typed text or pasted text\r\n\r\nYou can type directly in the app, paste text from anywhere, import files, open links, or simply take a photo of a page or printed text using your camera. The summarizer recognizes the content and turns it into structured summaries automatically.\r\n\r\nText Summary is flexible by design. You decide how the information should be explained and how you want to work with it, depending on how much detail you need and what you plan to do next.\r\n\r\nAvailable summary and content formats include:\r\n• Extract summary\r\n• Highlighted key points\r\n• Bullet points\r\n• Abstract overview\r\n• Paraphrase\r\n• Rewrite\r\n• Keywords\r\n• Word Cloud\r\n• Translation\r\n• Quiz\r\n• Flashcards\r\n• Concept map\r\n• My notes\r\n• Chat with your text or summary\r\n\r\nQuizzes and flashcards are automatically generated from your own text or summary, allowing you to quickly test your understanding and reinforce key ideas without rereading everything.\r\n\r\nWith My notes, you can write, edit, and save your own notes directly inside the app. Use it to keep personal thoughts, add context, rewrite ideas in your own words, or store important takeaways for later. Your notes stay available so you can return to them anytime.\r\n\r\nThe chat feature lets you interact directly with your content. You can ask questions about your text or summary, clarify specific sections, explore ideas, or dive deeper into topics without leaving the app. This allows you to actively work with information instead of passively reading it.\r\n\r\nText Summary also includes a curated catalog of popular book summaries. These summaries are designed to help you understand key ideas, themes, and structure, making them useful before reading a book, after reading it, or when you want a clearer overview to decide what to explore next.\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nType or paste text, add a link, import files, or take photos of pages with your camera. Choose the summarizing format you want and get a clear, structured result in seconds. You can switch formats, refine outputs, save notes, or explore the content further using chat.\r\n\r\nAdditional features:\r\n• Adjustable summary length\r\n• Text-to-speech with automatic language detection\r\n• Share summaries or export them as PDF\r\n• Multi-language support\r\n• Works with very long texts and large documents\r\n• Easy sharing from other apps directly into Text Summary\r\n\r\nText Summary is made for busy people who don’t want to waste time reading everything. It helps you stay informed, move faster, and focus on what’s important without overload.\r\n\r\nUse Text Summary to:\r\n- Turn 50-page reports into 2-page summaries\r\n- Study textbook chapters in minutes instead of hours\r\n- Understand research papers without reading every detail\r\n- Review meeting notes and extract action items\r\n- Get the key points from news articles instantly\r\n- Prepare for exams with auto-generated quizzes\r\n- Create study guides from lecture notes\r\n- Quickly evaluate books before buying or reading\r\n\r\nYou can start with daily free summaries.\r\nA subscription unlocks unlimited usage, faster processing, advanced formats, and an ad-free experience.",

    "description": "Make an effort to do better text summary. Boost your output! All of this may be done using the  text summary app, an effective tool that creates a summary of everything. It is very important to use a tool that can perform effective summarization. The quality of the summarization depends on the performance of the tool. \r\n\r\nWhat Is Text Summarizer AI or resoomer?\r\nIt is an AI-based program that summarizes large texts into shorter ones. The most important sentences in a summarized document are generally included in the summary. Text Summarizer AI may condense three or four paragraphs into one.\r\n\r\nWhy Summarizing Tool Is Important?\r\nWhen reading long posts on a smartphone, it's challenging. A huge screen is commonly used to format content. Smartphone users are forced to undertake a tiresome mix of magnification and swipe motions in order to read the content on their devices. As the narrative progresses, commercials begin to appear. \r\n\r\nText Summary app allows the phone user to swiftly grasp essential ideas in the information that was meant to be read on a bigger display. It provides a succinct description that is simple to read and adapted for smartphones and tablets.\r\n\r\nWhat to Expect from Text Summarizer?\r\nThe summarization process is automated. Users are free to leave the tool to their own devices. This is what makes the tool different from human summarizers. It is not easy to do the job manually. \r\n\r\nHuman summarizers are often under-qualified and lack the skill to condense lengthy texts. Text Summarizer AI, on the other hand, is an automated tool that is easy to use. It is simple to operate. It is not difficult to understand the instructions. It is also easy to understand. \r\n\r\nText Summarizer AI is effective. It can condense large texts into shorter ones. It is also effective at generating text summary of long text.\r\n\r\nOther Features\r\n\r\nChoose the Percentage of Summarization:\r\nThis tool has an advanced summarization function.

You do not need to purchase the tool in order to use it. It is easy to install and easy to use.\r\n\r\nQuick and Safe:\r\n\r\nThe summarization process is fast and safe. It is not a risky operation. You do not have to worry about your device being damaged or your information being lost. The tool is user-friendly. \r\n\r\nAchieve Reliable Outcomes:\r\n\r\nThis automatic Text Summarizer has a built-in verification feature. It can identify and highlight any errors in the summary. The errors are identified using a machine learning algorithm. The tool is also able to correct the errors automatically. It is possible to identify and correct errors manually.\r\n\r\nUse Offline:\r\n\r\nYou can use the free text summarizer app offline as well. The strong summarizer and paraphraser feature of this app make it unique. \r\nSummarize Links and URLs from Other Apps:\r\nThis tool can be used to summarize links and URLs from other apps. It is possible to summarize a link from a browser or from another app. The summary can be shared via email, social media, or other platforms.\r\n\r\nSo, get this app today and start summarizing the long texts on your smartphone.",
