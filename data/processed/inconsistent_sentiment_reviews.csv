266f1211-60bd-4f9c-92d5-69a2c19e0587,com.aisense.otter,1,Awesome app. It has dark mode. It provides 600 mins for free. Failed to recognise KANNADA audio recording
ff2a3d09-f17c-4bd3-ae13-516c5e11bb7a,com.aisense.otter,2,"I love the AI transcription tool in this so much and the little summaries it gives. However, I can not believe it offers only 10 imports month for the pro plan?? I mean, the amount of minutes is reasonable, but with this very few number of files I can import?! At the same time, I don't need all the perks for the business plan.. This is literally the only reason why I had to go with the other AI transcription tool"
b328e67e-3fca-4094-9651-6881e5a89c87,com.aisense.otter,1,"Great idea six years ago, now the app regularly (as in most times) misplaces the recording. Wholly unreliable. Screen on phone says I have 2hr37min of recording, but export the audio file and I get 9 minutes of recording."
1e83462b-2b99-4c86-8f98-3ead4a358ba0,com.aisense.otter,1,I have been using this app on my iPhone and the summary after the meetings were great. now of the android OS the same feature isn't there and there isn't a way to add AI Smart Summary. I'm going to have to try a different app.
df8776bc-43c3-4b01-9ec0-486845f7764a,com.aisense.otter,4,Not bad
c48e09ac-eb61-4b5c-b25f-5348afd1adc6,com.aisense.otter,2,"You can't edit summaries. Really disappointed. It's great for recording, transcribing, and makes a nice AI summary, but when the summary missed a key point (surely this is going to happen regularly?) I couldn't edit it! Also my second recording the transcription stopped a few mins in although the audio continues. The AI was no help at resolving either of these issues, had to ask a few different ways until it understood me but then I'd maxed out my AI questions limit. Moving to a competitor 🤷"
b65d48ba-c64a-4f4c-a372-33f7de30eb03,com.aisense.otter,1,"I get that you're trying to offer great and a lot of features, but the app is absolutely not usable, at least for my use case, which is, i press a button, you record an audio, i stop the recording, you give me a transcription. there is probably a way to do it but the other features are getting in the way soo much"
993adced-4773-4a6c-8ea8-a9908610e054,com.aisense.otter,1,I was very hopeful for this app but was extremely not helpful would not upload my recorded meeting and when it did only did part of the meeting I tried for days to get this to work ended up using fireflies in the end.
218dbc08-41a1-4f38-af42-abd0f95f27f0,com.aisense.otter,2,"It is a great app with some functionalities others does not have like include pictures while transcribing and live transcription, persons names, vocabulary and channels, but limitations of languages (needs to include portuguese!!!), not possible in app management of subscription, max time 90 min, and the outrageous reduction of minutes on paid Pro subscription is making me think about not renew it. Suggestions to improve: add mind map feature (Plaud), soundbites (fireflies), and key points."
709db5a1-48ec-467f-b65d-68d1add44f40,com.aisense.otter,2,"Transcription not great, misses a lot of words and writes the complete wrong thing eg ""that's his daughter"" was transcribed to ""grandaughter"""

This is an AMAZING app and is crucial in my projects, but has recently began a behavior that is absolutely DETRIMENTAL to using it. For me to be able to use this app I need to be able to pause, then come back. THE APP HAS STARTED KICKING OFF THE PAUSE WHILE IN THE BACKGROUND. I continuously come to find hours of recording which uses up a lot of time, and the file has reached it's maximum. Started doing this within the last month. Fixed, will switch back to 5 stars! :)"
25a8d361-0707-4ba2-bb8b-051391efd910,com.aisense.otter,1,"I started with a free trial and only needed it for a few months. When I went to cancel the subscription, it was nearly impossible to find. The FAQ was completely unhelpful and incorrect. There was no link to ""Settings"" or anything like it. I finally managed to find the cancellation button but only after clicking on anything and everything to see what I could find. I don't trust an app with such underhanded tactics because what else might they be doing that they refuse to make clear?"
0dd35361-479b-419e-b0e2-708005c344a0,com.aisense.otter,1,"I liked this app because it was simple and worked. I signed up for the paid plan, but since then they've added things that I would never use and made the app more complicated and worse at what it used to do well. I'm going back to the unpaid version, which isn't very good anymore either, and hoping that I can get my old recordings backed up."
bd96c2a0-bf21-4d2c-baa2-4bb02029452c,com.aisense.otter,2,"Free version used to be great! Now, it's holding all my recordings hostage. I can't view them unless I upgrade to the premium version. I can't even download them. OtterAI still lets you record as many things as you like, but then holds on to them to try to bait you to upgrade. You can only view the most recent 25. I'm hoping if I delete the first 25, I will gain access to some of the other ones."

The app is showing you all the paragraphs in every meeting that have the searched words, but when clicking , the click is not always taking you to the exact paragraph but to the beginning of the meeting. Why is sometimes working and sometimes not? Very bad"

3cd7e82b-fe7a-485a-8911-1c53b337df6a,ai.turbolearn,2,ok first thing the app is great but the one that takes it down is that you have to pay to use it which sucks which is annoying the fact that it won't be you access your notes highly recommend of you are willing to pay😭
4d01c89b-af46-430c-85cf-772365a4d864,ai.turbolearn,2,it's actually very helpful but I would love it if it was free.

I've had this app for a couple months now. The app does great at summarizing and providing actionable bullet points...when it works, BUT the app doesn't open for me very often. I'm actively looking for a dependable app."
875b9a94-c1b1-4792-9d00-6220fde767d1,com.codespaceapps.meetingtranscriber,2,when I first started using this app. it worked great but the past few times it hasn't been recording my lectures for class and I am going to have to find a new one. The last lecture recorded shows 71 minutes but when I got to play it and never recorded the content. very disappointed.

3f6aff65-61e2-4ea9-8af1-41299aa42e7c,com.codespaceapps.meetingtranscriber,1,"Sometimes it fails to create the note, even letting you try only once, and then you lose the note. It doesn't make sense to lose the content of your note and only contain the summary, if you want the great notes with a large amount of content, I don't recommend this app because it only stores the summary and not the actual content. I regret having subscribed for a year to this app and I only use it for two days."

If they had take the time to fix my issue and/or recover my information, would have been a great beautiful app."

Had a great convo and when it went to transcribe it craved out. It seems samsung's voice recorder does a better job and is free.
6bdb53a4-af91-4989-b2cf-387eae85fd0e,com.codespaceapps.meetingtranscriber,1,Worked great for my needs for several months. Now nothing happens when I upload files. Can't continue to pay a weekly subscription for something that works 0% of the time now

It's been great, but now I can't find a way to get the year subscription. I'd like to see a way to manage your subscription in the app. there was a little bit of a dialog with the developer, but the problem was not resolved, hence losing stars. Honestly, if there was a way to change your subscription rather than 7 bucks a week, I'd happily give it 5 stars. (weekly is rough on my budget)"

But instead I’m told I have ""0 free meetings left!"" and must upgrade before getting access. No warning, no count down, no upfront explainer. I can't even download my own meeting transcript!!

It started skipping meetings, and after reaching out to their customer service about it, I got a response 2 days later.

42d574b5-89ba-48a5-b796-86049a05175b,notion.id,5,It's a really good app to be honest. Bugs sometimes when you first open it and immediately open a new note but I'm sure that will be fixed with an update. Other than that everything works as it should and the most important this is that it's the only notes app I've found that can hold the size of words I need my phone notes app to hold. Cheers to the devs.

d51f029a-85bb-4978-ac88-052b2b0835d7,notion.id,2,Although the app is amazing and every featured and the appearance is amazing but I have only one complaint with this app that it lacks the feature of handwritten notes which is quite useful for a student who makes notes by himself for his studies with a stylus and it is quite hard to make notes with keyboard or something. Instead please add a feature of making notes with a stylus and this will make your app a complete package of features. After that no app will be at your level I bet this.

ae0d4829-5b9d-425c-b4f2-63c3adfc087d,com.topstack.kilonotes.pad,1,Loved this app but it's acting really weird that's why I gave it one star. The first thing is that I couldn't login to my account after I deleted the app and the second thing is that I just could not purchase VIP at all in my account and when I deleted the app and I again installed the app from Play Store but I could not login to my account and all because I don't know it was just showing errors.
