Features:\r\n* simple interface that most of the users find easy to use\r\n* no limits on note's length or number of notes (of course there's a limit to phone's storage)\r\n* creating and editing text notes\r\n* importing notes from txt files, saving notes as txt files\r\n* sharing notes with other apps (e.g. sending a note by email)\r\n* notes widget allowing to quickly create or edit notes, working like post it notes (stick a memo to home screen)\r\n* backup function for saving and loading notes from a backup file (zip file)\r\n* app password lock\r\n* color themes (including dark theme)\r\n* note categories\r\n* automatic note saving\r\n* undo/redo changes in notes\r\n* lines in background, numbered lines in a note\r\n* technical support\r\n* search function that can quickly find text in notes\r\n* unlock app with biometrics (e.g. fingerprint or face recognition)\r\n\r\nIt may be obvious, but notes in the app can be used in many ways. For example as a to do list to increase productivity. A sort of digital planner to store shopping list or to organize the day. Notes can be put on the home screen as reminders. Each task could be stored in a seperate note or one big todo note could be used.\r\n\r\n** Important **\r\nPlease remember to make a backup copy of notes before formatting a phone or buying a new phone. Since the 1.7.0 version the app will also use phone's device copy, if it's turned on in the device's and the app's settings.\r\n\r\n* Why do I advise to not install the app on an SD card?\r\nI follow the official advice to block installing on an SD card apps that use widgets. This app uses widgets, which are like icons for the notes, and can be placed on a phone's home screen (for example).\r\n\r\nIf you have any additional questions, just contact me by email: notepad.free@outlook.com .\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nArek",

Instead of reading full books, long documents, articles, or pages of text, Text Summary helps you extract what actually matters and presents it in clear, easy-to-digest formats.\r\n\r\nWhether you are working, researching, studying, or just trying to stay informed, Text Summary helps you cut through the noise and understand content in minutes instead of hours.\r\n\r\nYou can summarize content from many different sources:\r\n\u2022 Books and written material\r\n\u2022 PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, EPUB, ODT, and TXT files\r\n\u2022 Web pages and long online articles\r\n\u2022 Photos and scanned documents\r\n\u2022 YouTube video links\r\n\u2022 Typed text or pasted text\r\n\r\nYou can type directly in the app, paste text from anywhere, import files, open links, or simply take a photo of a page or printed text using your camera. The summarizer recognizes the content and turns it into structured summaries automatically.\r\n\r\nText Summary is flexible by design. You decide how the information should be explained and how you want to work with it, depending on how much detail you need and what you plan to do next.\r\n\r\nAvailable summary and content formats include:\r\n\u2022 Extract summary\r\n\u2022 Highlighted key points\r\n\u2022 Bullet points\r\n\u2022 Abstract overview\r\n\u2022 Paraphrase\r\n\u2022 Rewrite\r\n\u2022 Keywords\r\n\u2022 Word Cloud\r\n\u2022 Translation\r\n\u2022 Quiz\r\n\u2022 Flashcards\r\n\u2022 Concept map\r\n\u2022 My notes\r\n\u2022 Chat with your text or summary\r\n\r\nQuizzes and flashcards are automatically generated from your own text or summary, allowing you to quickly test your understanding and reinforce key ideas without rereading everything.\r\n\r\nWith My notes, you can write, edit, and save your own notes directly inside the app. Use it to keep personal thoughts, add context, rewrite ideas in your own words, or store important takeaways for later. Your notes stay available so you can return to them anytime.\r\n\r\nThe chat feature lets you interact directly with your content. You can ask questions about your text or summary, clarify specific sections, explore ideas, or dive deeper into topics without leaving the app. This allows you to actively work with information instead of passively reading it.\r\n\r\nText Summary also includes a curated catalog of popular book summaries. These summaries are designed to help you understand key ideas, themes, and structure, making them useful before reading a book, after reading it, or when you want a clearer overview to decide what to explore next.\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nType or paste text, add a link, import files, or take photos of pages with your camera. Choose the summarizing format you want and get a clear, structured result in seconds. You can switch formats, refine outputs, save notes, or explore the content further using chat.\r\n\r\nAdditional features:\r\n\u2022 Adjustable summary length\r\n\u2022 Text-to-speech with automatic language detection\r\n\u2022 Share summaries or export them as PDF\r\n\u2022 Multi-language support\r\n\u2022 Works with very long texts and large documents\r\n\u2022 Easy sharing from other apps directly into Text Summary\r\n\r\nText Summary is made for busy people who don\u2019t want to waste time reading everything.

When you scan this QR code with the smart board application, the smart board will automatically connect to your school. Teachers who want to unlock the smart board can use the smart board application. You can turn on the smart board remotely by clicking on the smart board and setting a time. The smart board will automatically lock when the time is up. If you want, you can also lock the smart board via the smart board application.\r\n\r\nYou can add all the teachers in your school under the school via the smart board application. Teachers can use the smart board application if they wish. Teachers who do not want to can open the boards with a USB flash memory by creating a key for their USB flash memory.

If you want, you can send announcements or messages to smart boards. Messages may contain links to web pages. When students click on the links, the web page will open even though the lock program is still active. In this way, you can send a web page link to students without unlocking the smart board. If you have pictures, videos or documents you want to share with your students, you can upload them to Google Drive and write the links in the message text. In this way, students can view the relevant document while the smart board is locked.\r\n\r\nYou can remotely turn off all smart boards in your school.

    "description": "Make an effort to do better text summary. Boost your output! All of this may be done using the  text summary app, an effective tool that creates a summary of everything. It is very important to use a tool that can perform effective summarization. The quality of the summarization depends on the performance of the tool. \r\n\r\nWhat Is Text Summarizer AI or resoomer?\r\nIt is an AI-based program that summarizes large texts into shorter ones. The most important sentences in a summarized document are generally included in the summary. Text Summarizer AI may condense three or four paragraphs into one.\r\n\r\nWhy Summarizing Tool Is Important?\r\nWhen reading long posts on a smartphone, it's challenging. A huge screen is commonly used to format content. Smartphone users are forced to undertake a tiresome mix of magnification and swipe motions in order to read the content on their devices. As the narrative progresses, commercials begin to appear. \r\n\r\nText Summary app allows the phone user to swiftly grasp essential ideas in the information that was meant to be read on a bigger display. It provides a succinct description that is simple to read and adapted for smartphones and tablets.\r\n\r\nWhat to Expect from Text Summarizer?\r\nThe summarization process is automated. Users are free to leave the tool to their own devices. This is what makes the tool different from human summarizers. It is not easy to do the job manually. \r\n\r\nHuman summarizers are often under-qualified and lack the skill to condense lengthy texts. Text Summarizer AI, on the other hand, is an automated tool that is easy to use. It is simple to operate. It is not difficult to understand the instructions. It is also easy to understand. \r\n\r\nText Summarizer AI is effective. It can condense large texts into shorter ones. It is also effective at generating text summary of long text.\r\n\r\nOther Features\r\n\r\nChoose the Percentage of Summarization:\r\nThis tool has an advanced summarization function.

You do not need to purchase the tool in order to use it. It is easy to install and easy to use.\r\n\r\nQuick and Safe:\r\n\r\nThe summarization process is fast and safe. It is not a risky operation. You do not have to worry about your device being damaged or your information being lost. The tool is user-friendly. \r\n\r\nAchieve Reliable Outcomes:\r\n\r\nThis automatic Text Summarizer has a built-in verification feature. It can identify and highlight any errors in the summary.

    "title": "Voice Notebook speech to text",
    "description": "The speech to text application that allows you to take voice notes and save them locally or send them to cloud services. Suitable for communication with deaf people.\r\n\r\n Supports a customizable list of replaceable words and punctuation for voice input; continuous speech recognition; letter capitalization control; undo command for the last speech input, triggered by a button or by voice.\r\n\r\n Can recognize speech in online and in  offline mode (offline mode not available for some devices and languages). \r\n\r\n Supports auto punctuation for major spoken languages.\r\n\r\n Notes can be tagged and filtered by tags.\r\n\r\nContains words and characters counter. Convenient for bilingual voice input. Exports notes to Documents or Download folder or sends them to any text program. Can import text files from file managers or Google drive. \r\n\r\nAllows you to save backup copies of notes with a customizable history depth.\r\n\r\nWhen you save notes, you can automatically upload them to Google Drive.\r\n\r\n Has a widget for convenient start. Integrated with Google Assistant,  note recording can be started and stopped by voice.\r\n\r\n The notes can be read aloud by android TTS engine.  \r\n\r\nRequirements for work:\r\n1. The application uses default Android speech recognizer and optimized to use voice input from Google, so the device (phone or tablet) must have Google speech recognizer App installed and updated(!)\r\n2.
